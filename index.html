            <p class="content2"><span>Virus:</span> A virus is a type of malicious software that attaches itself to legitimate programs
                or files and spreads to other files or systems when these programs are run.
                It typically requires user action to activate and can corrupt or delete files,
                steal data, and disrupt operations.
            </p>
                <div class="details-container">
                    <h3>Types of Viruses</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>1. Boots Selector Virus:</dd>
                        <dt>A computer virus that infects a computer's hard drive master
                            boot record or the removable storage device. Once inside, it
                            takes control before loading the operating system because it
                            activates before the loading process.</dt>
                        <dd>2. Direct Action Virus:</dd>
                        <dt>The virus attaches itself to an executable file and is only
                            activated when the infected file runs. It does not embed in
                            the system and only executes when the infected file executes.
                        </dt>
                        <dd>3. Resident Virus:</dd>
                        <dt>Unlike direct action viruses, macro viruses implant themselves
                            into the system's memory so that they can execute and spread
                            without having to be triggered through a specific file.
                            This makes them harder to trace and delete.</dt>
                        <dd>4. Macro Virus:</dd>
                        <dt>These viruses target applications that support macros,
                            such as Microsoft Word or Excel. They are activated when
                            the document containing the virus is opened and can spread
                            through email attachments or shared files.</dt>
                        <dd>5. FAT Virus (File Allocation Table Virus):</dd>
                        <dt> This type of virus infects the File Allocation Table (FAT) of a disk.
                            It modifies the table to point to infected files, allowing it to
                            spread and potentially damage files and data on the storage device.

                    <dd>2. Bug:</dd>
                    <dt>A "bug" refers to a flaw or unintended behavior in a software program.
                        Although not typically categorized as malware, some bugs can be exploited
                        to perform malicious actions.
                    </dt>
                    <dd>3. Rootkit:</dd>
                    <dt>A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain and maintain privileged access
                        to a system while concealing its presence. Rootkits can be used to hide other
                        malicious programs and are often extremely difficult to detect and remove.</dt>
                    <dd>4. Trojan Horse:</dd>
                    <dt>A Trojan horse is a type of malware that is disguised as a legitimate program or file.
                        It does not replicate itself but may contain malicious code that can steal data,
                        provide remote access to attackers, or damage the system.
                    </dt>
                    <dd>5. Ransomware:</dd>
                    <dt>Ransomware encrypts the files on a victim's device and demands payment (ransom) to restore access.
                        It can spread through malicious email attachments, infected websites, or compromised software updates.
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="content2"><span>Spam:</span> Spam refers to unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate messages
                sent over the internet, primarily via email. While spam itself isn't inherently malicious,
                it can be a carrier of malware or phishing attempts, posing a security risk.

            <p class="content2">Antivirus programs are designed to detect, block, and remove known threats like viruses, worms,
                and some types of malware. They use signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and real-time
                scanning to identify threats based on known patterns or behaviors. Antivirus programs help
                prevent malware infections and provide a first line of defense against cyber threats.</p>

                <p class="content2">No, relying solely on antivirus programs is not sufficient for comprehensive security.
                    While antivirus software can catch many threats, it cannot defend against all types of attacks,
                    such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) or zero-day vulnerabilities. Other critical security measures include:
